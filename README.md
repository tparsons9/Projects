## XGBoost.ipynb

As I researched political measures for my current position, I became interested in the Compositite Index of National Capability (CINC) -- A 6-item measure that has been used in International Relations/Political Science research to determine the power and capabilities of a country. However, there have been several calls for modifying or expanding upon CINC, namely due to the lessening of global reliance on coal (which is a significant indicator for the index). I wondered if it were possible to run a boosting method using a variety of indicators collected from the Quality of Government (QoG) dataset developed by the University of Gothenburg. My hope was to find which indicators, other than the ones currently used, assisted in predicting these CINC Scores.

## Regression Discontinuity Patient and PCP.ipynb

This was an example project where I began researching Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). The purpose of this project was to gain a general understanding of RDD and apply it to an interest. My significant other is a medical student, and the intersection of marketing and medicine is of great interest to me, so I wanted to see how RDD can be used in this discipline. Data were simulated to represent distance to Primary Care Physician (PCP) and the willingness to seek medical treatment, however, I would like to pursue surveys for future research. At this point, the data were not readily available. 

The "idea" behind RDD in this context, was that we could determine ideal pop-up clinic locations based on a localized study. We can measure the ATE of a pop-up clinic based on original distance and the post-treatment effect on willingness to visit a PCP.

This is an rmd file where I use XGBoost to predict housing prices for a kaggle competition.
